requirement of data 
-------------------
    1. data integraty : Data should be accurate e.g. my facebook profile should contain valid country name.
    2. data availability : I should be able to access facebook and see my data at all times.
    3. data security : Only my friends should be able to see my posts and no one else.
    4. concurrent :  All my friends should be able to see my posts at the same time.
    
Data is stored in flat files and can be accessed using any programming language. The file based approach suffers following problems:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1. Dependency of program on physical structure of data
  2. Complex process to retrieve data
  3. Loss of data on concurrent access
  4. Inability to give access based on record (Security)
  5. Data redundancy
  
  
function of DBMS
----------------
  1. utility : data import/export, data management, user login ,
  2. integrity : data accuracy
  3. security : access data to authenticated user 
  4. data management : modifucation, store, retrive 
  5. recovery : recovery of data no data lose
  6. tracsaction support : ensure of notification to databases must either be successful or not to be done 
  7. concurrency control : simulteneously all user access the data


Terminology
-----------
    row == tuples == records =========> employee(id, name, dob)
    attribute == columns == fields ========> employee(id, name, dob)

    no of records == rows == tuples =======> cardinality of relations
    The set of permitted values of an attribute is called =====>Domain


candidate key:
--------------
    A candidate key are used to uniquely identify the single tuple in columns. 
    for example:
              right candidate key
              -------------------
                    1. employee_id
                    2. name and bob
                    3. aadharNo
              not right candidate key for columns
              ----------------------------------- 
                    1. salary
                    2. name 

primary key
-----------
    A primary key are used to uniquely identify the typle in a relation 
          mendatory ===> must uniquely identify the tuple and not allows null values 

        When two or more columns together identify the unique row then
        it's referred to as Composite Primary Key.
        The combination of Name and DateOfBirth if selected as a primary key would be a composite primary key.


foreign key
-----------
    foreign key are the set of one or more table in child table that required to match with parent table
    foreign key are used to stablish the relationship between two table. here the parent class should be unique and primary and child table can be null 
        
        for example:
        -----------
                Computer is the parent table with CompId as the primary key.
                Employee is the child table with Id as the primary key.
                If we want to allocate a maximum of one computer to an employee then CompId must be made the foreign key in the Employee table. 
                It can only contain values that are present in Computer table or no values at all.
                We cannot allocate a computer that does not exist to an employee.
                Additionally multiple rows in the child table can link to the same row of the parent table dependening upon the type of relationship.
