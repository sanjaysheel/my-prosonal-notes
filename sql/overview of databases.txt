requirement of data 
-------------------
    1. data integraty : Data should be accurate e.g. my facebook profile should contain valid country name.
    2. data availability : I should be able to access facebook and see my data at all times.
    3. data security : Only my friends should be able to see my posts and no one else.
    4. concurrent :  All my friends should be able to see my posts at the same time.
    
Data is stored in flat files and can be accessed using any programming language. The file based approach suffers following problems:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1. Dependency of program on physical structure of data
  2. Complex process to retrieve data
  3. Loss of data on concurrent access
  4. Inability to give access based on record (Security)
  5. Data redundancy
  
  
function of DBMS
----------------
  1. utility : data import/export, data management, user login ,
  2. integrity : data accuracy
  3. security : access data to authenticated user 
  4. data management : modifucation, store, retrive 
  5. recovery : recovery of data no data lose
  6. tracsaction support : ensure of notification to databases must either be successful or not to be done 
  7. concurrency control : simulteneously all user access the data


Terminology
-----------
    row == tuples == records =========> employee(id, name, dob)
    attribute == columns == fields ========> employee(id, name, dob)

    no of records == rows == tuples =======> cardinality of relations
    The set of permitted values of an attribute is called =====>Domain


candidate key:
--------------
    A candidate key are used to uniquely identify the single tuple in columns. 
    for example:
              right candidate key
              -------------------
                    1. employee_id
                    2. name and bob
                    3. aadharNo
              not right candidate key for columns
              ----------------------------------- 
                    1. salary
                    2. name 

primary key
-----------
    A primary key are used to uniquely identify the typle in a relation 
          mendatory ===> must uniquely identify the tuple and not allows null values
