        <p>R is a programming language developed by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman in 1993. R possesses an extensive catalog of statistical and graphical methods. It includes machine learning algorithm, linear regression, time series, and statistical inference
            to name a few. Most of the R libraries are written in R, but for heavy computational task, C, C++ and Fortran codes are preferred. R is not only entrusted by academic, but many large companies also use R programming language, including Uber,
            Google, Airbnb, Facebook and so on. Data analysis with R is done in a series of steps; programming, transforming, discovering, modelling and communicate the results</p>
