operator in python 
------------------------------------
there are 7 types of operator in python

1.  Arithmatic operator
2. assignment operator
3. compairesion operator
4. logical operator
5. identity operator
6. membership operator 
7. bitwise operator


1.  Arithmatic operator
		
		1.1 addition (+)
		1.2 subtraction (-)
		1.3 multiplication (*)
		1.4 division (/)
		1.5 floor devision (//)
		1.6 modulos (%)
		1.7 exponentition (**)



2. assignment operator

		2.1 addition (+=)
		2.2 subtraction (-=)
		2.3 multiplication (*=)
		2.4 division (/=)
		2.5 floor devision (//=)
		2.6 modulos (%=)
		2.7 exponentition (**=)
		2.8 equal (=)
		2.9 right shift (>>)
		2.10 left shift (<<)
		2.11 and (&=)
		2.12 or (|=)
		2.13 xor (^=)


3. compairesion operator

		3.1 equal (==)
		3.2 less then (<)
		3.3 greater then (>)
		3.4 less then equals to (<=)
		3.5 greater then equals to (>=)
		3.6 not equal (!=)

4. logical operator
	
		4.1 and (and)
		4.2 or (or)
		4.3 not (not)

5. identity operator:

	Identity operators are used to compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location:

		5.1 Returns True if both variables are the same object (is)
		5.2 Returns True if both variables are not the same object (is not)

6. membership operator:
	
	Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object:

		6.1 Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object (in)
		6.2 Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object (not in)

7. bitwise operator

		7.1 and (&)
		7.2 or 	(|)
		7.3	not (~)
		7.4 xor (^)
		7.5 Zero fill left shift (<<)
		7.6	Signed right shift (>>)
